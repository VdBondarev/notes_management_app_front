# The Frontend of Notes Management Application README

## [See the detailed video-explanation on starting and using both backend and frontend applications by following this link.](https://www.loom.com/share/7ec76ef8a02144bb93836066957f34ce?sid=b76b5c6e-363f-4e58-9848-03c076361ea4)

## Main technologies used

- **React (v18.3.1):** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, useful for managing state across the application.
- **React-Redux:** Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Redux Toolkit:** The official, recommended way to write Redux logic, offering good defaults and simplified configuration.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application.
- **Cypress:** A front-end testing tool.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js (v14.0.0 or later) installed.
3. Start the backend application first (the instruction of how to do it put in its README.md file).
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Start the application: `npm start`.
- Optionally: run `npm run test:cypress` for running all the tests
