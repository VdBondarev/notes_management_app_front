- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, useful for managing state across the application.
- **React-Redux:** Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Redux Toolkit:** The official, recommended way to write Redux logic, offering good defaults and simplified configuration.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application.
- **Cypress:** A front-end testing tool.
